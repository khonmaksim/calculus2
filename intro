ch1: This chapter studies vector-valued functionsâ€”functions that output vectors instead of single numbers. 
ch2: This chapter extends single-variable calculus to functions of several variables and introduces partial derivatives.
ch3: This chapter introduces double and triple integrals, which extend single integrals to functions of two or three variables, representing areas and volumes.
ch4: This chapter introduces line and surface integrals, which help analyze work, mass, fluid flow, and electromagnetic forces.
